Facebook Graph API using Python

Curent features:

--> getting total number of reactions (likes, haha, love, and other shitty stuff) received on a user's posts, photos, etc (can be modified by object_types parameter passed to top_friends() function)
--> finding the top 'friends' (if you want to call them) with their number of reactions/likes on your posts, photos, etc.

Looking for suggestions :) Please message if you have any interesting ideas
